I came to America a year Ago. I am a originally from Nigeria in Africa.
I have always had interest in programming and related technologies in general.
These interests sparked up my love and decision to study Computer Science at IIT.
I consider myself a Lazy problem solver as I enjoy tasking my brain to find the easiest ways out of problems.
Since the days of really understanding my surroundings, I have always had a passion for helping people and I figured the most impactful areas would be Education and Health Care.
This is really moved me to making commitments to make most of all my profits geared to both areas. Aside these, I really enjoy music, aesthetic views and Adventurous Outings.
I am currently chasing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with interests in Machine Learning and Security as I am really interested in see how both can be leveraged to play big roles in the real world.
I expect to get from this class the knowledge to enable me express my presence on the web.
