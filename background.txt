I came to America a year Ago. I am a originally from Nigeria in Africa. I
have always had interest in programming and related technologies in general.
These interests sparked up my love and decision to study Computer Science at
IIT. I consider myself a lazy problem solver as I enjoy tasking my brain to
find the easiest ways out of problems. Since the days of really
understanding my surroundings, I have always had a passion for helping
people and I figured the most impactful areas would be Education and Health
Care. This has really moved me to making commitments to make most of all my
profits geared to both areas. Aside these, I really enjoy music, aesthetic
views and Adventurous Outings.
I am currently chasing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with
interests in Machine Learning and Security as I am really interested in see
how both can be leveraged to play big roles in the real world. I expect to
get from this class the knowledge to enable me express my presence on the
web.
