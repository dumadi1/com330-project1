# Project One: Background and Ambitions
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
You will write three to four paragraphs about your background as well as your ambitions for this class and your career at IIT and beyond. Begin by writing this in either simple plain text (.txt) or Markdown (.md) in your text-editor of choice. Be sure to make frequent, descriptive commits in Git as you write. Once you have finished your plain-text version, use git tag to tag it as plain-text. You will then create a basic structured HTML page out of your plain-text work (revision to your content is encouraged), styled with a separate, basic stylesheet in CSS that is linked to your HTML via the tag. Commit this also to Git as you write.
